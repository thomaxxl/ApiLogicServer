# API Logic Server

### TL;DR - Executable Software, *now*

**ApiLogicServer** creates customizable projects with a single command.

After [installing](#installation), 
get started by creating the sample project:

```
ApiLogicServer run
```

After you've explored the sample, use your own database:
```
ApiLogicServer run --db_url=mysql+pymysql://root:p@localhost/classicmodels
```

The created project is **executable** and **customizable,** providing the following features:

### Tutorials
There are a number of facilities that will quickly enable you to get familiar with API Logic Server:
* [Tutorial](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Tutorial) walks you through the steps of creating a server
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVTdu6c0iSI) shows the steps of creating a server
* [Cloud Demo](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServerTutorial) enables you to run the demo using a cloud-based (MyBinder) install

### Background

There is widespread agreement that APIs are strategic
to the business, required for mobile apps and internal
/ external systems integration.

The problem is that they are time-consuming and costly to develop.
This reduces strategic business agility.

API Logic Server provides exceptional strategic business agility,
by creating an executable server for a database, instantly.
Working Software, now.
 
This **declarative approach** is based on standard Python tooling,
and can be [installed](#Installation) and customized with standard approaches as described below.


# Quick Start - Create and Run
With a single command, create and run a
[logic](#logic)-enabled
[JSON:API](#api-safrs-jsonapi-and-swagger) and
[web app](#basic-web-app---flask-appbuilder) for your database:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/raw/main/images/creates-and-runs.png"></figure>

### Run ApiLogicServer CLI
As illustrated above, you run the ApiLogicServer CLI:
```
ApiLogicServer run        # note: you can also create (without execution)
```

The CLI provides a number of options you can discover with ```ApiLogicServer --help```.
In particular:
1. The ```-db_url``` parameter defaults to a supplied [sample database](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Sample-Database).

   * Specify a [SQLAlchemy url](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html)
to use your own database.
   

2. By default, the project name (directory) is ```api_logic_server```- override it with the
```-project_name``` option.


3. Discover other options with ```ApiLogicServer run --help```


### Creates Customizable Project
The CLI introspects your database, and creates a project.
You can open this in your IDE and customize it as shown below.

### Runs Project - Working Software Now

The CLI then starts the API. As illustrated above, the project implements:

1. Your ___API___, available in Swagger

2. With underlying ___logic___

3. And a ```basic_web_app```


### Customize the Created Project
Here is the created project;
you can open it in any IDE or Editor - here it is in PyCharm:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/raw/main/images/generated-project.png"></figure>

Typical [customizations](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/ApiLogicServer-Guide) include
(explore the default sample database to see examples):

* **Customize API:** edit ```api/expose_services.py``` to define your own endpoints,
  complementing those created from the model
  

* **Customize Model:** edit ```models_ext.py```, for example
    * to define [relationships](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/Managing-Rules#database-design), critical for multi-table logic, APIs, and web apps
    * to describe derived attributes, so that your API, logic and apps are not limited to the physical data model


* **Customize Logic:** edit ```models/logic_bank.py``` (initially empty) to declare logic
    * The default sample database project contains some simple rules you can review;
  learn more about rules in the [Logic Bank](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank)


After customization, your ```api_logic_server``` project can be re-executed (without creating).
To run it:
1. Specify a proper ```venv``` (virtual environment)
   
   * The one used for ApiLogicServer install is fine, or you can use a project-specific
    [virtual environment](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/ApiLogicServer-Guide#environment)
    
2. Then:

```
python api_logic_server_run.py
python ui/basic_web_app/run.py
```


# Features

### API: SAFRS JSON:API and Swagger

Your API is instantly ready to support ui and integration
development, available in swagger, as shown below.  JSON:APIs are interesting because they
are client configurable to **reduce network traffic** and **minimize organizational dependencies.**

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/raw/main/images/swagger.png"></figure>

> Customize your API by editing ```api/expose_services.py```, and see [Customizing](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/ApiLogicServer-Guide#customizing-apilogicprojects)

### Logic

Transactional business logic - multi-table derivations and
constraints - is a significant portion of database systems,
often nearly half.  Procedural coding is time-consuming
to develop and maintain, reducing business agility.

ApiLogicServer integrates Logic Bank, spreadsheet-like rules
that reduce transaction logic by 40X.
Logic is declared in Python (example below), and is:

- **Extensible:** logic consists of rules (see below), plus standard Python code

- **Multi-table:** rules like ``sum`` automate multi-table transactions

- **Scalable:** rules are pruned and optimized; for example, sums are processed as *1 row adjustment updates,* rather than expensive SQL aggregate queries

- **Manageable:** develop and debug your rules in IDEs, manage it in SCS systems (such as `git`) using existing procedures

The following 5 rules represent the
[same logic](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/by-code)
as 200 lines of Python:
<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/raw/main/images/example.png"></figure>

> Declare your logic by editing: **```logic/logic_bank.py```**


### Basic Web App - Flask Appbuilder

UI development takes time.  That's a problem since
* Such effort may not be warranted for admin "back office" screens,
and
  
* [Agile approaches](https://agilemanifesto.org) depend on getting _working
software_ soon, to drive _collaboration and iteration_.

ApiLogicServer CLI therefore creates working software _now:_
multi-page, multi-table applications as shown below:

1. **Multi-page:** apps include 1 page per table

2. **Multi-table:** pages include ``related_views`` for each related child table, and join in parent data

3. **Favorite fields first:** first-displayed field is "name", or `contains` "name" (configurable)

4. **Predictive joins:** favorite field of each parent is shown (product *name* - not product *id*)

5. **Ids last:** such boring fields are not shown on lists, and at the end on other pages

<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valhuber/fab-quick-start/master/images/generated-page.png"></figure>

> Customize your app by editing: **```ui/basic_web_app/app/views.py```**

> Before running, [some setup is required](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Working-with-Flask-AppBuilder) for Flask App Builder (except for Northwind, which is pre-created).


# Installation
Caution: Python install is rather more than running an installer.
Use this page to [Verify / Install Python](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Python-Verify-and-Install).

Then, install the ApiLogicServer CLI in the usual manner:

```
virtualenv venv            # may require python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # windows venv\Scripts\activate
pip install ApiLogicServer # you may need to restart your terminal session
```

### Important News - Certificate Issues
We are starting to see Python / Flask AppBuilder Certificate issues - see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Troubleshooting#certificate-failures).

### Default Python version
In some cases, your computer may have multiple Python versions, such as ```python3```.  ```ApiLogicServer run``` relies on the default Python being 3.8 or higher.  You can resolve this by:
* making ```python3``` the default Python, or
* using ```ApiLogicServer create```, and running ```python3 api_logic_server_run.py```

# Learning
Take the [tutorial](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Tutorial) to run your locally installed software.

If you'd like to try it with no install on the Cloud, use [this version of the Tutorial](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServerTutorial#readme).

# Project Information

### Status

Initially released 1/19/2021, the project has stabilized:

* The [default Northwind project](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Sample-Database) is working with for both the API and the web app,
  with pre-created logic (good to explore for examples)
  

*   We have tested several sqlite databases, and several MySQL databases -
    see [status here.](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/wiki/Testing)
    These are successfully creating / executing the API and the web app.

We are tracking [issues in git](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer/issues).
